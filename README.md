# Redux Feedback Loop

## Description
This app takes in answers to a survey about how you are
feeling, understanding, and supported from the day's lesson.
To begin, click the start link. Enter a number reflecting how
you feel about the questions, and add a comment if you want 
at the end.

All answers are immediately stored in Redux, and when submitted
are sent to the database and stored there forever. You must 
enter a number for each question, but the comment input may
be left blank. If you want to change an answer before submitting
it, you can go back by clicking the `Back` button.
